# Solana

The Fair LaunchPad platform is built on a series of Solana smart contracts that handle token creation, allocation, vesting, bonding curves, and liquidity provision. This document explains the technical architecture and contract interactions that power the platform.

## Contract Architecture Overview

The Fair LaunchPad system consists of several interconnected smart contracts that work together to provide a complete token launch solution:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Token Factory Contract] --> B[Token Metadata Contract]
    A --> C[Allocation Contract]
    C --> D[Vesting Contract]
    A --> E[Bonding Curve Contract]
    E --> F[Liquidity Contract]
    F --> G[Launchpad Contract]
    A --> H[Fee Contract]
```

## Token Creation Flow

When a user creates a new token through the Fair LaunchPad interface, the following sequence of contract interactions occurs:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant TF as Token Factory
    participant TMC as Token Metadata Contract
    participant SPL as SPL Token Program
    
    User->>UI: Configure token parameters
    UI->>TF: Create token request
    TF->>SPL: Create mint instruction
    SPL-->>TF: Return mint address
    TF->>TMC: Set token metadata
    TMC-->>TF: Confirm metadata
    TF->>SPL: Mint initial supply
    SPL-->>TF: Confirm mint
    TF-->>UI: Return token details
    UI-->>User: Display token creation success
```

## Allocation and Vesting Flow

When configuring token allocations and vesting schedules:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant AC as Allocation Contract
    participant VC as Vesting Contract
    participant Token as Token Account
    
    User->>UI: Configure allocations & vesting
    UI->>AC: Create allocation instructions
    AC->>Token: Reserve token allocations
    Token-->>AC: Confirm reservations
    AC->>VC: Create vesting schedules
    VC->>VC: Store vesting parameters on-chain
    VC-->>AC: Confirm vesting setup
    AC-->>UI: Return allocation details
    UI-->>User: Display allocation success
```

## Bonding Curve Mechanism

The bonding curve contract manages token price discovery:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Buyer
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant BC as Bonding Curve Contract
    participant Token as Token Account
    participant Treasury as Treasury Account
    
    Buyer->>UI: Purchase tokens
    UI->>BC: Execute purchase
    BC->>BC: Calculate token price based on curve
    BC->>Treasury: Deposit payment
    Treasury-->>BC: Confirm deposit
    BC->>Token: Transfer tokens to buyer
    Token-->>BC: Confirm transfer
    BC-->>UI: Return purchase details
    UI-->>Buyer: Display purchase success
```

## Liquidity Provision Flow

When the token is ready for DEX listing:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant LC as Liquidity Contract
    participant DEX as Decentralized Exchange
    participant Token as Token Account
    
    Admin->>UI: Initiate liquidity provision
    UI->>LC: Execute liquidity setup
    LC->>Token: Reserve tokens for liquidity
    Token-->>LC: Confirm reservation
    LC->>DEX: Create liquidity pool
    DEX-->>LC: Return pool address
    LC->>DEX: Add initial liquidity
    DEX-->>LC: Confirm liquidity added
    LC-->>UI: Return liquidity details
    UI-->>Admin: Display liquidity success
```

## Launchpad Sale Flow

The public token sale process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Investor
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant LP as Launchpad Contract
    participant Token as Token Account
    participant Treasury as Treasury Account
    
    Investor->>UI: Participate in token sale
    UI->>LP: Submit investment
    LP->>LP: Verify eligibility (whitelist, caps)
    LP->>Treasury: Deposit investment funds
    Treasury-->>LP: Confirm deposit
    LP->>Token: Calculate token allocation
    LP->>LP: Record investor allocation
    LP-->>UI: Return investment details
    UI-->>Investor: Display investment success
```

## Fee Management Flow

The fee collection mechanism:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Token as Token Contract
    participant FC as Fee Contract
    participant Treasury as Fee Treasury
    
    User->>Token: Execute token transaction
    Token->>FC: Calculate fee amount
    FC->>Token: Deduct fee from transaction
    Token->>Treasury: Transfer fee amount
    Treasury-->>FC: Confirm fee collection
    FC-->>Token: Allow transaction to complete
    Token-->>User: Return transaction result
```

## Security Features

The Fair LaunchPad contracts implement several security features:

### Mint Authority Revocation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant Token as Token Contract
    participant SPL as SPL Token Program
    
    Admin->>UI: Request mint authority revocation
    UI->>Token: Initiate revocation
    Token->>SPL: Set mint authority to null
    SPL-->>Token: Confirm authority change
    Token-->>UI: Return revocation status
    UI-->>Admin: Display revocation success
```

### Liquidity Locking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant UI as Fair LaunchPad UI
    participant LC as Liquidity Contract
    participant Timelock as Timelock Contract
    
    Admin->>UI: Configure liquidity lock
    UI->>LC: Set lock parameters
    LC->>Timelock: Create timelock for LP tokens
    Timelock-->>LC: Return timelock address
    LC-->>UI: Return lock details
    UI-->>Admin: Display lock confirmation
```
