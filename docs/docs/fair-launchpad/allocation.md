# Token Allocation

The allocation section allows you to define how your token supply will be distributed among different stakeholders or purposes. Proper allocation is crucial for your token's economics and governance.

## Understanding Token Allocation

Token allocation refers to how you distribute your token's total supply across different categories such as team members, investors, community rewards, liquidity pools, and more.

The platform shows your remaining allocation percentage, ensuring you don't exceed 100% of your total supply.

## Adding Allocations

Click the "Add Allocation" button to create a new allocation category. You can create multiple allocations for different purposes.

For each allocation, you'll need to configure:

### Description (Optional)
A label for the allocation, such as "Team", "Marketing", "Treasury", etc.

### Percentage
The percentage of the total token supply assigned to this allocation.

## Managing Allocations

You can add multiple allocations until your total reaches 100%. Each allocation can be edited or removed before final deployment.
