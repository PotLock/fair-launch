# Launchpad Configuration

The launchpad configuration allows you to set up a public token sale with customized parameters. This is where initial investors can participate in your token offering before it's available on exchanges.

## Understanding Launchpads

A token launchpad is a platform for conducting Initial Token Offerings (ITOs) or public sales. It helps you distribute tokens to early supporters in a controlled and fair manner.

## Configuring Your Launchpad

### Launch Type

Select the type of launch mechanism you want to use:

- **Whitelist**: Only pre-approved addresses can participate in the token sale
- **Public**: Anyone can participate in the token sale
- **Fair Launch**: First-come, first-served with equal opportunity for all participants

### Soft Cap and Hard Cap

Set the minimum and maximum amounts you aim to raise:

- **Soft Cap**: The minimum amount to raise for the launch to be considered successful
- **Hard Cap**: The maximum amount that can be raised in the token sale

### Sale Duration

Configure when your token sale will start and end:

- **Start Date**: When the token sale will begin
- **End Date**: When the token sale will conclude

### Contribution Limits

Set the minimum and maximum contribution amounts per participant:

![Contribution Limit Fields](https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/237/200/300.jpg?hmac=TmmQSbShHz9CdQm0NkEjx1Dyh_Y984R9LpNrpvH2D_U)

- **Minimum Contribution**: The smallest amount an investor can contribute
- **Maximum Contribution**: The largest amount an investor can contribute

These limits help ensure fair distribution and prevent whales from dominating the sale.

## Whitelist Settings

If you selected a whitelist launch type, configure the whitelist parameters:

- **Token Price**: Fixed price per token for whitelisted participants
- **Whitelist Duration**: How long the whitelist registration period will last

### Managing Whitelist Addresses

Add wallet addresses to your whitelist either individually or by uploading a CSV file:

You can:
- Type addresses manually
- Upload a CSV file with multiple addresses
- Download a sample CSV template

## Launchpad Best Practices

### For Community-Focused Projects
- Launch Type: Fair Launch or Public
- Soft Cap: 30-50% of Hard Cap
- Low minimum contribution (0.1 SOL or less)
- Reasonable maximum contribution (5-10 SOL)

### For Established Projects
- Launch Type: Whitelist
- Higher minimum contribution (0.5-1 SOL)
- Longer whitelist duration (7-14 days)
- Pre-marketing to build a quality whitelist

### For High-Demand Projects
- Launch Type: Whitelist with lottery
- Lower maximum contribution (2-5 SOL)
- Shorter sale duration (24-48 hours)
- Anti-bot measures enabled
