# Vesting Schedule

The vesting schedule determines how allocated tokens are released over time. This is particularly important for team tokens, investor allocations, and other stakeholders to ensure long-term commitment to the project.

## Understanding Vesting

Vesting is the process of releasing tokens gradually over a predetermined period rather than all at once. This helps:

- Demonstrate team commitment to long-term success
- Prevent large sell-offs that could negatively impact token price
- Align incentives between token holders and project development timelines

## Creating Vesting Schedules

To create a vesting schedule, toggle the vesting feature on and click "Add Vesting Schedule".

For each vesting schedule, you'll configure:

### Description (Optional)
A label for the vesting schedule, such as "Team Vesting", "Advisor Vesting", etc.

### Percentage
The percentage of total supply that will follow this vesting schedule.

### Cliff Period
The initial period (in days) during which no tokens are released. After the cliff period ends, the first tokens become available.

The cliff period represents the time before tokens start vesting, creating an initial waiting period.

### Vesting Duration
The total duration (in days) over which tokens will be released after the cliff period.

### Vesting Interval
How often tokens are released during the vesting period (in days). For example, a 30-day interval means tokens are released monthly.

## Vesting Timeline

The platform provides a visual representation of your vesting schedule, showing how tokens will be released over time.

This timeline helps you visualize:
- When tokens begin to vest (after cliff periods)
- The rate of token release over time
- When vesting completes for different allocations
