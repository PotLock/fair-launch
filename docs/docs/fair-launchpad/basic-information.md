# Basic Information

The first step in creating your token is defining its fundamental properties. This includes the token name, symbol, description, and initial supply.

## Token Name and Symbol

Your token's name and symbol are its primary identifiers in wallets, exchanges, and other applications.

- **Token Name**: Choose a name that represents your project (maximum 30 characters)
- **Token Symbol**: Create a short abbreviation for your token (maximum 10 characters)

:::tip Best Practices
- Choose a unique, memorable name that reflects your project's purpose
- Keep your symbol short (2-5 characters) and easy to remember
- Verify your name and symbol aren't already in use by searching on blockchain explorers

## Token Description

While optional, a good description helps users understand your token's purpose and utility.

## Supply

The supply field determines the initial number of tokens that will be created in your wallet. This represents the total available tokens for your project.

The supply you set here will be the maximum number of tokens that can ever exist if you choose to revoke mint authority later.

## Decimals

The decimals field determines how divisible your token will be. For example, a token with 3 decimals can be divided down to 0.001 units.

:::tip Recommendation
- For most use cases, 6-9 decimals provides good balance
- Use fewer decimals (2-3) for tokens that aren't meant to be highly divisible
- Use more decimals (9+) for tokens that may reach high individual values

## Logo

Adding a logo helps with brand recognition and makes your token more professional when displayed in wallets and exchanges.

You can either upload your own logo or generate one using AI. The logo should be:
- Square format (1:1 ratio)
- At least 200x200 pixels (512x512 recommended)
- Less than 5MB in size

## Tags (Optional)

Tags help categorize your token and make it more discoverable. You can select up to 3 tags that best describe your project.

## Social Links (Optional)

Adding social links to your token metadata helps users find more information about your project and community.

![Social Links Section](https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/237/200/300.jpg?hmac=TmmQSbShHz9CdQm0NkEjx1Dyh_Y984R9LpNrpvH2D_U)

You can add links to:
- Website
- Telegram
- Twitter/X
- Discord

These links will be embedded in your token's metadata and visible to users who view your token details.

Once you've completed the basic information section, click "Next" to proceed to the token allocation configuration.
