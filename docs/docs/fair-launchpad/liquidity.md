# Liquidity Configuration

The liquidity configuration determines how your token will be made available for trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Proper liquidity is essential for a healthy token market.

## Understanding Liquidity

Liquidity refers to how easily your token can be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. Good liquidity means:
- Smaller price impact for trades
- Lower slippage for traders
- Better overall trading experience

## Configuring Liquidity

### Launch Liquidity On

Select the decentralized exchange where your token's liquidity will be launched:

![DEX Selection](https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/237/200/300.jpg?hmac=TmmQSbShHz9CdQm0NkEjx1Dyh_Y984R9LpNrpvH2D_U)

The platform shows current statistics for your selected DEX, including:
- 24h Trading Volume
- Total Value Locked (TVL)

### Liquidity Source

Choose where the initial liquidity for your token will come from:

- **Bonding Curve**: Use funds raised from the bonding curve to create the initial liquidity pool
- **Team Reserves**: Use your team's own funds to create the initial liquidity pool
- **External Source**: Use funds from another source (like private investors) to create the liquidity pool

### Liquidity Percentage

Determine what percentage of the raised funds will be used to create the initial liquidity pool:

A higher percentage means:
- More initial liquidity
- Better price stability
- Lower slippage for early traders

### Liquidity Lockup Period

Set how long the initial liquidity will be locked and cannot be removed:

![Liquidity Lockup Field](https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/237/200/300.jpg?hmac=TmmQSbShHz9CdQm0NkEjx1Dyh_Y984R9LpNrpvH2D_U)

Longer lockup periods signal commitment to the project and protect against "rug pulls" where liquidity is suddenly removed.

:::tip
A minimum of 180 days (6 months) liquidity lock is recommended to build trust with your community.

## Anti-Bot Protection

Enable anti-bot protection to prevent automated trading bots from taking advantage of your token launch:

This feature helps ensure a fair launch by limiting how quickly bots can buy large amounts of your token.

## Post-Launch Strategy

Configure what happens after your token is launched on the DEX:

- **Auto-Listing**: Automatically list your token on popular aggregators like Jupiter and Birdeye
- **Price Protection**: Implement mechanisms to reduce price volatility during the first 24 hours
- **Automated Market Making**: Enable automated market making to ensure liquidity and reduce slippage

## How Liquidity Works

The platform provides a helpful explanation of the liquidity process:

This explains how your token transitions from the bonding curve phase to being freely tradable on a DEX.

## Liquidity Best Practices

### For New Projects
- Liquidity Percentage: 30-50% of raised funds
- Lockup Period: 6-12 months
- Enable Anti-Bot Protection
- Enable Price Protection for the first 24-48 hours

### For Established Projects
- Liquidity Percentage: 20-40% of raised funds
- Lockup Period: 3-6 months
- Consider automated market making for better liquidity depth

:::caution
Insufficient liquidity can lead to high price volatility and poor trading experience, potentially damaging your project's reputation.
